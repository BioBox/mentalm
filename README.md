# mentalm
mentalm is a program meant to help you get better at mental math.

## Requirements
The only requirement is that you have Python 3 installed.

## Basic Usage
The way to use it is `python3 main.py -cfg <config_file>` where config_file is a .ini file that specifies how many questions there should be, range of the numbers, etc. If one is not provided, it will simply use `default.ini`. See `samples` for an idea of how it works.
You can quit a test at any time by entering 'q' or 'Q'.
